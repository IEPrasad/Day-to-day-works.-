	virtual environments in Python provide a way to create isolated and self-contained 
	environments for Python projects. They allow you to manage dependencies and 
	packages separately for different projects, preventing conflicts and ensuring 
	that each project has its own set of libraries. Virtual environments are crucial 
	for maintaining a clean and organized development environment, enhancing 
	reproducibility, and simplifying package management in Python projects. 
	The venv module, virtualenv package, and conda are common tools used to create 
	and manage virtual environments in Python.


	
1) make folder for the project
2) command prompt 
	cmd: pip install virtualenv
3) go to the project folder
4) make the virtual environment
	cmd: virtualenv (virtual_environment folder name)
	ex:
		cmd virtualenv env1
